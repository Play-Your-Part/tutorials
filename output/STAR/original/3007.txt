User: I need some help with my medicine.
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: My name is John.
System: Who is your doctor?
User: I think his name was Dr. Johnson, I can't exactly remember..
System: Your instructions are: Take your medicine before you go to sleep. If you experience nausea, please contact your doctor immediately..
User: Huh.. I guess that sounds right. I'm just gonna go to bed I guess.
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: I think my doctor may be wrong about my proper dosage, he seems like he's no good at his job, oh well.
System: Thank you and goodbye.
