User: I saw Dr. Morgan the other day and would like to talk to him about the visit.
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: My name is Mark. Oh, I think it was actually Dr. Johnson I saw at my last appointment. Dr. Morgan was my old doctor.
System: Your instructions are: You must take your medicine 2 times a day before meals..
User: Okay, I had some strange dreams and hoped it wasn't from my medical issue.
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: I just wanted to make sure I got everything clear with what the doc said. That should do it, thanks.
System: Thank you and goodbye.
