System: Hello, how can I help?
User: I just finished up an appointment with Dr. Alexis and I need to check in because I don't think I totally understand everyting.
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: Yes my name is Angela.
System: Your instructions are: Take your medicine before you go to sleep. If you experience nausea, please contact your doctor immediately..
User: Ok thank you for the information.  I guess I should pay better attention when the doctor tells me something.
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: No that is it!  Thank you!
System: Thank you and goodbye.
