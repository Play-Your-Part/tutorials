User: I need some help.
System: How can I help you?
User: I just saw Dr. Morgan, no, or maybe it was Dr. Johnson. But I can not remember the medication instructions and I think I am really confused right now. I may have taken too much.
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: I saw a rainbow, and I wanted to find the gold.
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: It's Ben, the rainbow guy.
System: Your instructions are: Take your medicine before you go to sleep. If you experience nausea, please contact your doctor immediately..
User: Oh, I was taking it all day. Maybe that's the problem.
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: No, thank you so much! I will only take it at night now.
System: Thank you and goodbye.
