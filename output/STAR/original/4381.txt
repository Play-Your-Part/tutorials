User: This is Mark. I forgot to write down my instructions from my appointment
System: Who is your doctor?
User: Dr. Alexis. 
System: Your instructions are: Take your medicine before you go to sleep. If you experience nausea, please contact your doctor immediately..
User: Wait. That does not make sense. I am really confused. If I take it before bed, how am I going to know if I am nauseous if I am asleep? 
System: If you wake up that way or throughout the night. Is there anything else?
User: Well it was a nice day in the park. Thanks. 
System: Thank you and goodbye.
