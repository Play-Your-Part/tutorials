User: Omg, I totally forgot my medicine instructions.
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: Alexis
System: Who is your doctor?
User: Well it was Johnson but he gave me the creeps so I switched to Dr. Alexis, since we have the same name you know.
System: Your instructions are: You must take your medicine 2 times a day before meals..
User: Oh of course, before eating. Ok great, maybe now I will stop twitching randomly.
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: I think that was all I needed, thanks.
System: Thank you and goodbye.
