User: Hi.  I took my medicine and I feel funny and really confused.  I am not sure if I took the medicine like I was supposed to.
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: It is Mark.  I think.  I'm pretty messed up at the moment.
System: Who is your doctor?
User: Dr. Morgan I think.
System: Your instructions are: Take your medicine before you go to sleep. If you experience nausea, please contact your doctor immediately..
User: Oh shoot Dr. Morgan is my old doctor.  I saw Dr. Johnson.
System: Your instructions are: You must take your medicine 2 times a day before meals..
