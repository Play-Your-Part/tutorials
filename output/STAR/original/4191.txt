User: Hello, this is John calling to follow up
System: Who is your doctor?
User: Dr. Alexis
System: Your instructions are: You must take your medicine 2 times a day before meals..
User: Oh dear. So you are saying I can only eat twice a day? I get hungry more than that usually. 
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: I think that cable is overpriced don't you? I think most people enjoy Netflix better
System: I am sorry, I don't quite understand what you mean. I am only able to help schedule a followup appointment with your doctor.
