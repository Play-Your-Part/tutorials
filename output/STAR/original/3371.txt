System: Hello, how can I help?
User: I need my meds and I need them now!!!
System: Who is your doctor?
User: Dr. Johnson, It used to be Dr. Morgan, but I believe he turned into a bird and flew away.
System: Your instructions are: Take your medicine before you go to sleep. If you experience nausea, please contact your doctor immediately..
User: Oh great, I feel much better now that I have my medicine. Now I need some legal marijuana.
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
