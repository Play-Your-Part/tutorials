User: Can you find out how to take my medication from Dr. Morgan?
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: I'm Ben. But I think my new doctor is Dr. Johnson. I'm just not 100% sure.
System: I have a message from Dr. Johnson to Ben which is: You must take your medicine 2 times a day before meals. Does that look right?
User: I don't know. I'm too old for this. I'm just gonna flush all my pills down the drain. good night.
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
