System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Hi! I just left my appointment with Dr. Johnson but forgot to write down his instructions. Could you remind me how often I should take my medicine? Thanks!
System: Of course, your doctor instructed that you should take the medication twice a day, in the morning and at night before bedtime. Is there anything else from the instructions you need help with?
User: That's perfect, thank you. No, that covers everything I needed to know. Thanks for your help! Goodbye.
System: You're welcome! If you have any more questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Have a great day!
