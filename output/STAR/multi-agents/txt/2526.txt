System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Hi! I just had an appointment with Dr. Alexis but forgot to write down when to take my medication. Could you please check what dosage instructions she gave?
System: Of course, let me look that up for you. Could I get your name, please?
User: Sure thing, my name is Angela. Thanks for helping!
System: Who is your doctor, Angela? I see you mentioned Dr. Alexis before. Is she the one who prescribed your medication?
User: Yes, that's right. It was Dr. Alexis who gave me the prescription. Could you please find out how often to take it?
System: Your instructions are: Take the medication twice a day, 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner. Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: That's perfect, thank you! No more assistance is needed from me today.
System: You're welcome, Angela. Thank you and goodbye.
