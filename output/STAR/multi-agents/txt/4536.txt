System: Hello! How can I help?
User: Hi, I was wondering if you could assist me with something related to my doctor's visit today. I forgot to write down how often I should take my medication. Could you find out for me please?
System: Of course, I can help with that. Could I get your name, please?
User: Sure thing, my name is Angela. Thank you for helping!
System: Who is your doctor, Angela?
User: My doctor is Dr. Alexis. She prescribed the medication during today's visit.
System: Your instructions are: Take the medication three times a day, 30 minutes before meals. Is there anything else that I can do for you?
