System: Hello! How can I help?
User: Hi, I need to follow up on some instructions from my last visit with Dr. Johnson. Could you remind me how often I should be taking my medication?
System: Of course, could I get your name, please? This will help me find your specific instructions.
User: Sure, it's Mark. Thanks!
System: Who is your doctor, Mark? Just to confirm, is it Dr. Johnson?
User: Yes, it's Dr. Johnson. Could you check the instructions for my medication frequency?
System: Your instructions are: Take your medication twice daily, in the morning and evening with meals. Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: That's perfect, thanks! No further assistance is needed at this time.
System: You're welcome, Mark. Thank you and goodbye.
