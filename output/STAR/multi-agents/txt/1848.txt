System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Hi! Just wanted to make sure I understood everything from my appointment with Dr. Morgan today. Could we go over a few points again please?
System: Of course, let's review your instructions from Dr. Morgan. Your doctor's orders are: INSTRUCTIONS. Is there anything specific you would like to clarify or add to this?

If you experience any severe reactions or symptoms such as SYMPTOMS, please contact Dr. Morgan immediately. Is there anything else you would like to discuss regarding your medication and health?
