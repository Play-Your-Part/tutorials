System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Could you please remind me of my doctor's instructions from my last visit with Dr. Johnson?
System: Of course! Could I get your name, please?
User: My name is Alexis.
System: Who is your doctor?
User: It's Dr. Johnson.
System: Your instructions are: Take the prescribed medication twice daily and follow up with a blood test in two weeks. Also, please schedule another appointment with Dr. Johnson after that for a check-up.
User: Thank you, that's what I thought but wanted to make sure. Is there anything else that I can do for you?
System: Not at this time, thank you Alexis!
