System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Could you remind me of the instructions Dr. Alexis gave during my last visit?
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: My name is Mark.
System: Who is your doctor?
User: It's Dr. Alexis, I was just seeing them last week for my annual check-up.
System: Your instructions are: Take one pill of medication X before breakfast every day until your next appointment in 3 months. Also, follow up with a blood test at the lab on the corner of Main Street and Elm Street after two weeks from now.
User: Got it, thank you for reminding me!
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
