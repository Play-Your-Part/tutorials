System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Could you please help me find out how often I should take my medicine? I just finished an appointment with Dr. Morgan but forgot to write down the instructions.
System: Of course, could I get your name, please?
User: My name is Alexis.
System: Who is your doctor?
User: I saw Dr. Morgan today.
System: Your instructions are: Take the medication three times a day, every 8 hours apart starting from when you left the office, with food and water. If you have any side effects or worsening symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.
User: Thank you so much!
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
