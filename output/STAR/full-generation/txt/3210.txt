System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Hi, my name is Angela. Could you please confirm what Dr. Johnson said during my appointment last week? I want to make sure I understood everything correctly.
System: Could I get your doctor's name, please?
User: My doctor is Dr. Johnson.
System: Your instructions are: Take 50 mg of the prescribed medication twice daily for two weeks. Follow up with an appointment in one month to review your progress and discuss any side effects or concerns you may have during that period.
User: Thank you, that's exactly what Dr. Johnson said. Is there anything else I should know?
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
