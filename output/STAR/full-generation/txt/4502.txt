System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Hi there, my name is Mark. Could you please confirm the instructions Dr. Johnson gave me during our last appointment?
System: Who is your doctor?
User: My doctor is Dr. Johnson.
System: Your instructions are: Take 50mg of the prescribed medication twice daily for one week, then schedule another follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss progress and next steps. Follow a low-sodium diet and increase your daily fluid intake.
User: Thank you very much. I just wanted to make sure I understood everything correctly.
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: No, that's all. Thank you so much!
System: Thank you and goodbye.
