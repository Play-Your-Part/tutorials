System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Could you please find out how often I should take my medicine from Dr. Alexis's office?
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: My name is Angela.
System: Who is your doctor?
User: It's Dr. Alexis.
System: Your instructions are: Take the medication twice a day, every 12 hours with food and water. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose.
User: Thank you so much!
System: Is there anything else that I can do for you?
