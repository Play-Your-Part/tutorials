System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Hi! Could you please remind me how often I should take my medication according to Dr. Alexis's instructions? I couldn't write them down during our visit and I don't want to forget. Thanks!
System: Could I get your name, please?
User: Of course, it's Alexis. Can you help me with the medication schedule from my recent doctor's visit?
System: Who is your doctor?
User: My doctor is Dr. Alexis. Could you check on the instructions for my medication dosage and frequency? I missed writing them down during our appointment. Thanks!
System: Your instructions are: Take your medication twice a day, 30 minutes before meals. Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: Thanks so much! That helps a lot. No, that covers everything for now. I appreciate your help. Bye!
System: Thank you and goodbye.
