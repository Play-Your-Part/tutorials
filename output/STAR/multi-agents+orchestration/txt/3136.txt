System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Hi! How are you today? I had an appointment with Dr. Alexis recently and I want to make sure I understood everything she told me about my medication. Could you please clarify the effects and side effects again? I want to be sure I'm taking it correctly.
System: Could I get your name, please? Once I have that, I can help clarify your doctor's instructions for your medication.
User: Of course, my name is Mark. And actually, Dr. Alexis was my previous doctor. The appointment I had recently was with Dr. Morgan. Could you help me understand the information from her about my current medication?
System: Who is your doctor? It seems like there might have been a mix-up. You mentioned seeing Dr. Morgan recently for your medication instructions, right? Let's focus on what Dr. Morgan told you. Can you tell me more about the concerns or specific questions you have regarding her advice?
User: Right, it was Dr. Morgan I saw last time. She prescribed a new medicine and I want to make sure I understand how it works. Today when I took my medication, I felt quite tired all of a sudden. Could this be a side effect?  And thanks for your help! It’s really reassuring to have someone clarify things for me. Hope you’re having a good day!  Goodbye!
System: Your instructions are: The fatigue you experienced after taking the medication could indeed be a side effect. It's important to monitor how you feel and if this continues or worsens, contact Dr. Morgan again for further advice.  Thank you, Mark! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. Have a great day!  Goodbye!
