System: Hello, how can I help?
User: Hi! Could you please remind me how often I should take my medication according to Dr. Alexis's instructions? I didn't get a chance to write them down during our appointment.
System: Could I get your name, please? Once I have that information, I can look up Dr. Alexisâ€™s instructions for you.
User: Of course, my name is Angela. Could you check the instructions for me, please?
System: Who is your doctor? Just to confirm, are we looking for instructions from Dr. Alexis or another physician?
User: Yes, we're looking for instructions from Dr. Alexis. Can you find out how often I should take my medication according to her advice?
System: Your instructions are: Take your medication twice a day, in the morning and before bedtime. Is there anything else that I can do for you?
User: Thank you! That's very helpful. No, that covers everything for now. Thanks so much!
System: You're welcome, Angela. If you have any more questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Thank you and goodbye.
